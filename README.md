## I, Robot

Robotic devices are becoming increasingly used in a variety of contexts to perform tasks and solve problems. In this project, students will be introduced to physical computing by designing and programming a two-wheeled robot prototype to perform useful tasks for people.

## What is a Robot?

Most people picture a human-like robot when they think of a "robot" – however, robotic devices vary widely in their purpose, size, capabilities, etc. Some robots have arms for grabbing or gripping objects. Some robots have wheels or legs for moving on surfaces. Some robots have propellors for moving through the air or water. It can be challenging to define what a robot is.

However, most people that study and create robotic devices generally agree that robots are physical computing devices that follow a "sense-think-act" cycle to autonomously interact with the physical world.

* **SENSE:**  Robotic devices typically have one or more **physical inputs** \(such as sensors, etc.\) that gather data from the physical environment.
* **THINK:**  Robotic devices are programmed to analyze data from their inputs to make decisions and respond to certain conditions by acting through their outputs.
* **ACT:**  Robotic devices typically have one or more **physical outputs** \(such as motors, etc.\) that can perform movements and actions in the physical environment.

The "Think" component requires a robot to be **autonomous** – it is programmed with an "artificial intelligence" to make its own decisions based on data. In some cases, this AI may be a relatively simple algorithm that only performs a specific task. In other cases, this AI may be capable of much more complex and adaptable behaviors.

If a device's actions are being decided and controlled directly by a human, then the device probably would **not** be considered a robot.  For example, a remote-controlled drone is not a true robot because it is not flying by "thinking" on its own.  However, a self-flying drone would be considered a robot.

This project is designed as a semester-long course for high school students. Here are the estimated times for completing each project phase:

| **Project Phase** | **Estimated Time** |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 Discover & Define Problem | 6 weeks |
| 2 Design & Build Solution | 4-6 weeks |
| 3 Evaluate & Refine Solution | 2 weeks |
| 4 Share Project with Public | 1 week |
