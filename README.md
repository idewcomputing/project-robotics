![RedBot \(Two-Wheeled Robot with Sensors\)](.gitbook/assets/redbot.jpg)

Robotic devices follow a "sense-think-act" cycle to interact with the physical world.

* **SENSE:**  IoT devices typically have one or more **physical inputs** \(such as sensors, etc.\) that gather data from the physical environment.
* **THINK:**  IoT devices are programmed to analyze data from their inputs to make decisions and respond to certain conditions by acting through their outputs.
* **ACT:**  IoT devices typically have one or more **physical outputs** \(such as motors, etc.\) that can do something in the physical environment.
