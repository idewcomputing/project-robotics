# 1-4 Study Robotics Design Patterns

## Objective

Outline important considerations when designing a robotics system.

We will follow our standard pattern for developing any technology solution...

> 1. Discover and Define a Problem
> 2. Design and Build a Solution 
> 3. Evaluate and Improve the Solution

**...but what are important considerations unique to robotics systems?** Let's investigate some of these important details. Having some foreknowledge of these details will help your team begin to form ideas.

## Instructions

1. Read [this article on the Robotics Design Process](http://www.galileo.org/robotics/design.html).
2. Outline the following from the reading.
   * **What practical functions can a robot provide?** List at least 5 with a short description in your own words.
   * **How might the physical form and aesthetics become an important decision?** Use your own words to describe this in a paragraph.
   * **How can you prototype and evaluate a robotics design before you build it?** Use your own words to describe this in a paragraph.
   * **What ethical considerations need to be considered?** Use your own words to describe this in a paragraph.

## ✓ Standard Deliverables

1. Document and submit your team's outline. \(Equivalent of about 3/4 to 1-page length\) 
2. Be prepared to discuss these concepts in class.

## ✓+ Advanced Deliverable

Research the concept of the "Uncanny Valley" and in a paragraph describe the implications of designing robots that are very life-like.
