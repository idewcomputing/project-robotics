# 2-2 Generate Pseudocode for Testing Scenarios

## Objectives

Describe the testing scenarios that your robot prototype will demonstrate, and then generate a set of [pseudocode](https://codehs.com/glossary/term/10) robot instructions to map out the programming logic needed for your robot to demonstrate these scenarios.

## Instructions

1. **Within your team, discuss the scenarios you want to demonstrate with your robot prototype.** You will want to produce **at least three** scenarios to demonstrate. These scenarios could represent:
   * different tasks that the robot will complete
   * variations of the same task which show the robot's **flexibility** \(e.g., ability to respond in different patterns such as traveling to different destinations, etc.\) or **adaptability** \(e.g., ability to respond to changes in the environment such as avoiding obstacles even if their location changes, etc.\).
2. **Write a clear and concise description of each scenario.** Each scenario can probably be described in about two or three paragraphs. Be sure to include:
   * the robot's overall task/goal for the scenario
   * a description of the objects, obstacles, or other features that the testing environment will need for the scenario
   * a stepwise description of what the robot will need to do to complete the task/goal for the scenario \(as well as any simulated steps\) — keep in mind that you can simulate certain steps as long your robot can meaningfully demonstrate the core functions of the task
3. **Create** [**pseudocode**](https://codehs.com/glossary/term/10) **for each scenario** to logically describe the specific steps \(in order\) that the robot's program will have to perform. Your pseudocode can combine plain language with "code-like" language \(such as `if` statements, etc.\). This will help prepare you for the actual coding of the robot.

## ✓ Standard Deliverables

Submit a document with the scenarios and pseudocode and be prepared to discuss each.

## ✓+ Advanced Deliverable

Include an _aesthetic_ elements to your descriptions that explains how you might make your demonstration compelling and awe-inspiring. What is really going to grab the attention of people during your presentation? Is it a visual element? Sound? A vibrant narrative story? Label this additional description as "Aesthetic Elements" in your document.
