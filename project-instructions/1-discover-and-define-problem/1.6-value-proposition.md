{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
Discuss and create a [value proposition](https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/design-practices/value-proposition) for your team’s smart device concept using this format:

* For \[describe target users\] who \[describe problem or need\], \[name of product\] is a \[describe type of product\] that \[describe benefit or value\].

Your team's value proposition is an “elevator pitch” that quickly communicates your smart device concept to outside people and helps provide focus to your team as you design, build, and evaluate your smart device.

### **❏ Deliverable**

Submit a document with your team's value proposition for your smart device concept.
