# 1.6 Value Proposition

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
Discuss and create a [value proposition](https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/design-practices/value-proposition) for your team’s robot concept using this format:

* For \[describe target users\] who \[describe problem or need\], \[name of product\] is a \[describe type of product\] that \[describe benefit or value\].

Your team's value proposition is an “elevator pitch” that quickly communicates your robot concept to outside people and helps provide focus to your team as you design, build, and evaluate your robot prototype.

## **❏ Deliverable**

Submit a document with your team's value proposition for your robot concept.
