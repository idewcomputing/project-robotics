## Instructions

Complete experiments 1 through 8 of the [Experiment Guide for RedBot](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/experiment-guide-for-redbot-with-shadow-chassis). \(You will skip experiment 9.\)

* If you have an [ultrasonic sensor](../../references/redbot-code-references/ultrasonic-sensor.md), be sure to connect and mount this sensor to your RedBot. Conduct an additional [experiment to test the ultrasonic sensor](../../references/redbot-code-references/ultrasonic-sensor.md#experiment-test-ultrasonic-sensor-using-serial-monitor) using the serial monitor.

If helpful, you can also refer to the [RedBot Code References](https://cxd.gitbooks.io/robotics-project/content/redbot-code-references.html) included within this project guidebook.

## ✓ Standard Deliverables

* Demonstrate the result of each activity as your teacher instructs.
* Maintain an organized code folder as you progress through each experiment.

## ✓+ Advanced Deliverable

* Conduct your own code experiment that demonstrates a novel way of using your robot. Document the code and demonstrate it to your teacher.
