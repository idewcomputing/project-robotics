{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
Your team will diagram and describe 3 task scenarios that your robot prototype could demonstrate. These tasks could represent:
   * different tasks that the robot will complete
   * variations of the same task which show the robot's **flexibility** \(e.g., ability to respond in different patterns such as traveling to different destinations, etc.\) or **adaptability** \(e.g., ability to respond to changes in the environment such as avoiding obstacles even if their location changes, etc.\).

Later, your team will program its robot to perform these tasks within a demo environment (6 feet by 6 feet). You'll create and place objects and other features in the environment to create a model of a real-world environment. For example, your demo environment might include walls or other obstacles. If necessary for your demonstration, you could move certain objects during or between tasks.

1. **Discuss and decide on the task scenarios that your team's robot prototype will demonstrate.** It might be helpful to create rough sketches of the robot demo environment (top-down view of square environment) to show possible objects and features, as well as the robot's possible path and actions as it completes the task.
2. **Write a clear and concise description of each task scenario.** Each task scenario could be described in one to three paragraphs. Be sure to include:
   * the robot's overall goal for the task scenario
   * a description of the objects or other features that the robot demo environment will include
   * an ordered list of the steps or behaviors that the robot will need to perform to complete the task scenario — keep in mind that you can simulate certain steps as long your robot can meaningfully demonstrate the main task
   * identify the robot sensors and behaviors needed to perform the task
   * a method to measure or evaluate the performance of the robot prototype in two regards, _failure avoidance_ and _performance quality_.
   * Failure avoidance: For example, "Our vacuuming robot will become stuck, lost, or inoperable, at most, only once in ten trials."
   * Performance quality: For example, "Our vacuuming robot will attain 90% floor coverage after 5 cleaning runs."
   * Include an _aesthetic_ elements to your descriptions that explains how you might make your demonstration compelling and awe-inspiring. What is really going to grab the attention of people during your presentation? Is it a visual element? Sound? A vibrant narrative story? Label this additional description as "Aesthetic Elements" in your document.
3. **Use your sketches to create a digital diagram for each task scenario.** The diagram should be a scaled, top-down view of the robot demo environment (which will be 6 feet by 6 feet square).
   * You can use this Google Drawing template: [Robot Task Scenario Diagram](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fqNABZjAmwUlYZkKo7XfT7m5DdAr7oB_JXSz5JRYq8U)
   * Draw the environment of the robot context first including the outer boundaries and objects that will be present. You will probably use a top view looking down.
   * Draw a likely robot path within that context using a dashed line.
   * Draw a representation of the robot at one position along the path that makes sense.
   * Create text annotations at key points on the path, if needed, and label any important objects in the drawing.
   * Be sure to make the image size large enough to make annotations legible.
   * Use simplified representations of objects and label if needed, rather than including highly detailed object representations. Circles, lines, and rectangles can go a long way.
   * Try to correctly scale objects relative to each other.
   * Use color, font, and line styles that make the diagram easy to see and understand.
