**Sketch** - Hand sketch your initial ideas for a scenario diagram for each concept and discuss with team mates. Sketching before working on a digital diagram will save you time and lead to a better result.

1. **Diagram** - Once you are comfortable with a way to visualize a concept scenario, construct the diagram in a program like Google Drawing. Below is a recommendation of how to proceed, but you may need to adapt.
   * Draw the environment of the robot context first including the outer boundaries and objects that will be present. You will probably use a top view looking down.
   * Draw a likely robot path within that context using a dashed line.
   * Draw a representation of the robot at one position along the path that makes sense.
   * Create text annotations at key points on the path, if needed, and label any important objects in the drawing.

     > * Be sure to make the image size large enough to make annotations legible.
     > * Use simplified representations of objects and label if needed, rather than including highly detailed object representations. Circles, lines, and rectangles can go a long way.
     > * Try to correctly scale objects relative to each other.
     > * Use color, font, and line styles that make the diagram easy to see and understand.
2. **List Robot Capabilities** - Simply list the robot sensors and features needed to make the prototype.
3. **Describe a Method to Measure the Prototype Performance** - Briefly describe a method to measure the prototype in two regards, _failure avoidance_ and _performance quality_.
   * Failure avoidance: For example, "Our vacuuming robot will become stuck, lost, or inoperable, at most, only once in ten trials."
   * Performance quality: For example, "Our vacuuming robot will attain 90% floor coverage after 5 cleaning runs."

## Instructions

1. **Within your team, discuss and decide on the task scenarios that your robot prototype will demonstrate.** You will want to have 3 tasks to demonstrate. These scenarios could represent:
   * different tasks that the robot will complete
   * variations of the same task which show the robot's **flexibility** \(e.g., ability to respond in different patterns such as traveling to different destinations, etc.\) or **adaptability** \(e.g., ability to respond to changes in the environment such as avoiding obstacles even if their location changes, etc.\).
2. **Write a clear and concise description of each scenario.** Each scenario can probably be described in about two or three paragraphs. Be sure to include:
   * the robot's overall task/goal for the scenario
   * a description of the objects, obstacles, or other features that the demonstration environment will include for the scenario
   * a stepwise description of what the robot will need to do to complete the task/goal for the scenario \(as well as any simulated steps\) — keep in mind that you can simulate certain steps as long your robot can meaningfully demonstrate the core functions of the task

## ✓ Standard Deliverables

Submit a document with the scenarios and pseudocode and be prepared to discuss each.

## ✓+ Advanced Deliverable

Include an _aesthetic_ elements to your descriptions that explains how you might make your demonstration compelling and awe-inspiring. What is really going to grab the attention of people during your presentation? Is it a visual element? Sound? A vibrant narrative story? Label this additional description as "Aesthetic Elements" in your document.
