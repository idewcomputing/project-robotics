1. **Within your team, discuss and decide on the task scenarios that your robot prototype will demonstrate.** You will want to have 3 tasks to demonstrate. These tasks could represent:
   * different tasks that the robot will complete
   * variations of the same task which show the robot's **flexibility** \(e.g., ability to respond in different patterns such as traveling to different destinations, etc.\) or **adaptability** \(e.g., ability to respond to changes in the environment such as avoiding obstacles even if their location changes, etc.\).
2. **Write a clear and concise description of each task scenario.** Each task scenario can probably be described in about two or three paragraphs. Be sure to include:
   * the robot's overall goal for the task scenario
   * a description of the objects, obstacles, or other features that the demonstration environment will include for the task scenario
   * an ordered list of the steps or behaviors that the robot will need to perform to complete the task scenario — keep in mind that you can simulate certain steps as long your robot can meaningfully demonstrate the main task
   * a method to measure or evaluate the performance of the robot prototype in two regards, _failure avoidance_ and _performance quality_.
   * Failure avoidance: For example, "Our vacuuming robot will become stuck, lost, or inoperable, at most, only once in ten trials."
   * Performance quality: For example, "Our vacuuming robot will attain 90% floor coverage after 5 cleaning runs."
   * Include an _aesthetic_ elements to your descriptions that explains how you might make your demonstration compelling and awe-inspiring. What is really going to grab the attention of people during your presentation? Is it a visual element? Sound? A vibrant narrative story? Label this additional description as "Aesthetic Elements" in your document.
3. **Sketch** - Hand sketch your initial ideas for a scenario diagram for each concept and discuss with team mates. Sketching before working on a digital diagram will save you time and lead to a better result.
4. **Diagram** - Once you are comfortable with a way to visualize a concept scenario, construct the diagram in a program like Google Drawing. Below is a recommendation of how to proceed, but you may need to adapt.

   * Draw the environment of the robot context first including the outer boundaries and objects that will be present. You will probably use a top view looking down.
   * Draw a likely robot path within that context using a dashed line.
   * Draw a representation of the robot at one position along the path that makes sense.
   * Create text annotations at key points on the path, if needed, and label any important objects in the drawing.

     > * Be sure to make the image size large enough to make annotations legible.
     > * Use simplified representations of objects and label if needed, rather than including highly detailed object representations. Circles, lines, and rectangles can go a long way.
     > * Try to correctly scale objects relative to each other.
     > * Use color, font, and line styles that make the diagram easy to see and understand.

   **List Robot Capabilities** - Simply list the robot sensors and features needed to make the prototype.
