# 1-7 Evaluate Concepts and Select One

## Objectives

Conduct evaluations with appropriate stakeholders for each concept and, as a team, choose a single concept to continue the project.

## Instructions

1. **Determine Stakeholders** - Determine what people could give you the most insightful feedback on your concept. Would experts in a particular domain help? Do you have access to them? Aim to have 3 or more people give you feedback on each concept. It will likely be a different set of 3 people for each concept.
2. **Schedule a Time with Stakeholders** - Plan a time to carefully present your concept to each person and collect his or her feedback.
3. **Outline a Script** - Plan how the evaluation will go and outline it. Not only use the outline to guide your evaluation, but use it for note-taking during your discussion with the stakeholder. Below are recommendations, but you may adapt.
   * Introduce yourself and explain that you are working with a team on a class project using robotics.
   * Thank the person for his or her time and explain that you invite honest and critical feedback.
   * Describe the concept. This would be a good time to use your problem statement.
   * Share your scenario diagram to provide more detail in how it would work and how you plan to measure performance of the prototype.
   * Allow the person to provide feedback as they like, but have questions prepared in the following three areas.
     * Feasibility - How feasible will it be to successfully program and test with the time you have? Your best/educated guess.
     * Concept Value - How much value do you expect people to see in the concept? How useful will the result be? Is it worth the effort?
     * Demonstration Appeal - How compelling do you think the demonstration will be? What is the wow factor?
4. **Practice** - Practice an evaluation with two classmates that are not in your group. Their feedback will be valuable as well.
5. **Conduct Evaluations with Stakeholders**  - Be sure to document the feedback you get, either as you are discussing or shortly after concluding the evaluation.
6. **Summarize evaluations** - Summarize the key points in the feedback for each concept. One clearly formulated paragraph for each concepts may be enough.
7. **Deliberate and Choose a Concept** - Discuss the outcomes of the evaluations and choose one concept to continue developing for the team project.

## ✓ Standard Deliverables

Document ...

* list of stakeholders interviewed for each concept \(just a meaningful description of each\)
* for each concept, a paragraph summary of the evaluation results \(3+ paragraphs total\)
* the final concept your team has chosen, including a paragraph on why it was chosen over the others.

## ✓+ Advanced Deliverable

Improve the chosen concept based on the evaluations. Document the improvements made and how the feedback influenced the changes.
