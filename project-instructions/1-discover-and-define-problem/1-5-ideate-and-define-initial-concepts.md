# 1-5 Ideate and Define Initial Concepts

## Objective

After each team member generates a list of ideas, clearly define three potential problems to solve and a brief description of how a robot could provide a solution.

## Instructions

1. **Generate a list of at least 15 ideas as a team.** That's five or more per team member. It is important to have a diverse set of ideas at first covering many types of contexts — robots for personal/home use, business/industry use, or public/government use. See the "idea sparks" at the bottom of this page for some inspiration.
2. **Share and discuss ideas within the team.** Be sure to listen to each team member's ideas and consider how you might adapt some of the ideas or synthesize \(combine\) ideas.
   * **IMPORTANT:** Given the limitations of your robot kit, your robot prototype does not necessarily have to perform every step of the intended real-life task. Instead, you might need to "simulate" certain steps. However, your robot should still be able to meaningfully demonstrate the core functions of the task.
   * For example, if the real-life robot is supposed to travel towards an object, pick it up using a robotic arm, and then carry it to a new location, then your robot prototype should be able to travel to the object and stop, then you could have a human pick up the object \(to simulate the robotic arm\), and then the robot should be able to travel to the new location and stop \(where the human might place the object down\).
3. **Compose three clear and distinct problem statements.** From your idea discussions determine three paths your team could take with the project. These three concepts should be distinct from each other and likely apply to different contexts. **Make sure that each concept is feasible with your robot. Be sure you can meaningfully demonstrate the concept using your robot's sensors and capabilities.** Below is a template for your problem statements: 
   * **We will create a** _**\[descriptive name for robot\]**_ **for** _**\[describe the problem context and/or affected people\]**_ **that** _**\[describe the improvement and value the robot will provide\]**_**.**
   * For example: We will create a robotic vacuum for home use that thoroughly cleans the floors with minimal oversight and avoids causing damage or injury. \(Yes, this example describes an already existing product\)
4. **For each problem provide a single paragraph that briefly describes how the robot will work.** What key features will it need and what sensors will be used?

## ✓ Standard Deliverables

Document ...

* Your teams initial idea list. 
* The problem statement and descriptive paragraph for each of your three team concepts.

Be prepared to discuss them in class.

## ✓+ Advanced Deliverable

For each of your three concepts, **identify and document existing robotic systems that are somewhat similar** and might provide insight on creating your concept. Be sure to label this work clearly in your documentation.
