# 1.5 User Research

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
Your team will conduct user research by interviewing potential users \(or other stakeholders\) for your robot concept. The interviews are an opportunity to better understand the users' needs and expectations by verifying: what tasks your robot could perform, and how users might expect the tasks to be performed.

Analyze your interview data to create a persona and scenario for a typical user \(or stakeholder\), which will help inform and guide your design process.  Here are [instructions](https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/design-practices/personas) that explain personas and describe the process for interviewing users to create a persona.

| Interview questions and persona are provided but lack clarity and offer limited value in understanding potential users/stakeholders for product. | Interview questions reveal valuable information about users/stakeholders. Persona provides thoughtful description of users/stakeholders that will guide the design of an effective solution. | Numerous and diverse set of people are interviewed, representing users and other key stakeholders. Multiple personas are created, providing insightful descriptions that will bring exceptional focus to the team's design work. |
