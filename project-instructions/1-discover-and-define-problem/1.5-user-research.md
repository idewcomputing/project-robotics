| Interview questions and persona are provided but lack clarity and offer limited value in understanding potential users/stakeholders for product. | Interview questions reveal valuable information about users/stakeholders. Persona provides thoughtful description of users/stakeholders that will guide the design of an effective solution. | Numerous and diverse set of people are interviewed, representing users and other key stakeholders. Multiple personas are created, providing insightful descriptions that will bring exceptional focus to the team's design work. |
