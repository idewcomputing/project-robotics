{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
You'll conduct background research to:

* better understand what a robot is
* become familiar with examples of different types of robots.

## Defining a Robot

1. Think about how you might define a "robot" in your own words:  What is a robot? How would you decide whether something was a robot or not?
2. Use these resources to learn more about robots:

   * **WATCH:**  [So, What is a Robot Really?](https://video.wired.com/watch/hardwired-so-what-is-a-robot-really) \(4 minutes to watch\)
   * **READ:**  [What is a Robot?](https://robots.ieee.org/learn/) \(7 minutes to read\)
   * **WATCH:**  [A Brief History of Our Robotic Future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlrr5b1XWoY) \(6 minutes to watch\)

   \*\*\*\*

## **Examples of Robots**

1. Review this article that categorizes [different types of robots](https://robots.ieee.org/learn/types-of-robots/).
2. Conduct an internet search to find a specific example for **three** different types of robots. For each robot, find information to summarize answers to the following:
3. What does the robot do?

* What makes it valuable as compared to not having it? \(For example: Does it perform the task more accurately or faster than people could do? Does it perform a task that people could not easily or safely do themselves? etc.\)
* What sensors, motors, data, and programming are needed for it to work?

## **❏ Deliverable**

Submit your summary of example robots.
