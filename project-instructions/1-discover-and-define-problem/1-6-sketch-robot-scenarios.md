# 1-6 Sketch Robot Scenarios

## Objectives

For each of your team's three concepts

* **Diagram scenarios** that detail the robot's actions in a particular context.
* **List the required capabilities of the robot**.
* **Describe a potential method of measuring the final prototype performance**.

## Instructions

1. **Sketch** - Hand sketch your initial ideas for a scenario diagram for each concept and discuss with team mates. Sketching before working on a digital diagram will save you time and lead to a better result.
2. **Diagram** - Once you are comfortable with a way to visualize a concept scenario, construct the diagram in a program like Google Drawing. Below is a recommendation of how to proceed, but you may need to adapt.
   * Draw the environment of the robot context first including the outer boundaries and objects that will be present. You will probably use a top view looking down.
   * Draw a likely robot path within that context using a dashed line.
   * Draw a representation of the robot at one position along the path that makes sense.
   * Create text annotations at key points on the path, if needed, and label any important objects in the drawing.

     > * Be sure to make the image size large enough to make annotations legible.
     > * Use simplified representations of objects and label if needed, rather than including highly detailed object representations. Circles, lines, and rectangles can go a long way.
     > * Try to correctly scale objects relative to each other.
     > * Use color, font, and line styles that make the diagram easy to see and understand.
3. **List Robot Capabilities** - Simply list the robot sensors and features needed to make the prototype.
4. **Describe a Method to Measure the Prototype Performance** - Briefly describe a method to measure the prototype in two regards, _failure avoidance_ and _performance quality_.
   * Failure avoidance: For example, "Our vacuuming robot will become stuck, lost, or inoperable, at most, only once in ten trials."
   * Performance quality: For example, "Our vacuuming robot will attain 90% floor coverage after 5 cleaning runs."

## ✓ Standard Deliverables

For each of the three concepts document and submit...

* **a diagram of a scenario** showing a potential path of the robot with descriptive annotations where the robot senses and reacts to the environment.
* **a list of required robot capabilities**
* **a method of evaluating prototype success**

## ✓+ Advanced Deliverable

Conduct an internal evaluation \(within your team\) of the concepts and compare each concept on the following three dimensions.

1. _Feasibility_ - How feasible will it be to successfully program and test with the time you have? Your best/educated guess.
2. _Concept Value_ - How much value do you expect people to see in the concept? How useful will the result be? Is it worth the effort?
3. _Demonstration Appeal_ - How compelling do you think the demonstration will be? What is the wow factor?

**Document your evaluation in a clear way.** Maybe you simply score the concepts on each dimension by rating them from 1 to 5.
