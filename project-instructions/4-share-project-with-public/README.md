# 4 Share Project with Public

Plan and practice your team's presentation to explain and demonstrate your solution to a public audience. Share the details of the solution and the process used to develop the solution, as well as your final findings and recommendations. Each team member will reflect on the project experiences and help celebrate the efforts and successes of their team and others.

This phase of the project will require about 1-2 weeks to complete. Your teacher will identify the specific deadline\(s\) for the task assignments.
