# Project Challenge

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="➤ CHALLENGE" %}
Each team must design, program, and test a prototype of a [two-wheeled robot](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12649) that demonstrates the completion demonstrates the completion of useful tasks within a specific context \(such as home, school, business, etc.\).

Your robot demonstration environment will be limited to 6 feet by 6 feet size. Your team will customize this area to simulate a real-world environment by adding walls, objects, etc.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="✓ DELIVERABLES" %}
Each phase of the project has a set of team deliverables, but they lead to these final deliverables from each team:

* **Robot Prototype and Demo Environment** that demonstrate robot completing tasks
* **Product Website** that explains your robot and includes a robot demo video
* **Project Poster** that highlights key features of your robot solution and key steps in creating it
* **Public Presentation** that demonstrates your robot solution and explains how it was designed and developed

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="★ CRITERIA" %}
Each team's smart device prototype must meet these design criteria:

* **Innovative:** your solution should be unique \(or an improvement over existing solutions\)
* **Feasible:** your solution should be possible to prototype with the given materials/resources
* **Useful:** your solution should fulfill a need, solve a problem, or improve an existing situation
* **Usable:** your solution should be easy to understand and efficient to use
* **Valuable:** your solution should be desirable and valuable to users/stakeholders

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="▲ CONSTRAINTS" %}
Each team's robot prototype and demonstration environment is subject to these constraints:

* Robot prototype must demonstrate tasks that require movement (i.e., using its motors and wheels). Otherwise, if the tasks don't require movement, the tasks could instead be completed by a non-robotic device.
* Robot prototype must use at least two physical inputs \(sensors, button, etc.\) and at least two physical outputs \(motors, LED light, etc.\) from the provided robotics kit.
* Robot prototype and demo environment might be a smaller-scale model or limited version \(as long as the main tasks of the robot can still be demonstrated\). 
* Robot prototype may have to simulate certain parts or actions \(as long as the main tasks of the robot can still be demonstrated\).
* Robot prototype and demo environment can include constructed parts \(e.g., cardboard, 3D-printed, etc.\) that provide functional and/or aesthetic value.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="◼ TEAM ROLES" %}
Each team will have 2-4 members that serve in one or more of these roles:

* **Design Lead:** leads research and evaluation of robot design
* **Development Lead:** leads programming of robot behaviors and tasks
* **Business Lead:** leads product analysis and marketing of robot concept
* **Project Manager:** leads team to ensure project completed successfully

**Teams of 2** need to designate one person as the Design Lead and the other person as the Development Lead. The Design Lead will also serve as the Business Lead, while the Development Lead will also serve as the Project Manager.

**Teams of 3** need to designate different people as the Design Lead, the Development Lead, and the Business Lead. One person will also need to serve as the Project Manager.

**Teams of 4** need to designate different people for each role.
