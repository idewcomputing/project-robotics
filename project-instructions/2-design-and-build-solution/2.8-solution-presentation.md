{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
You'll create a **slide presentation** that explains and demonstrates the robot prototype that your team designed and developed as your project solution. Practice your presentation before delivering it to your class. This will be an opportunity for other project teams to ask questions and provide constructive feedback to help your team improve its solution.

Your team's presentation should include the following \(in this order\):

1. **Project Team:** product name, team name, team members & their roles
2. **Value Proposition:** Be sure the value proposition is clear and compelling.
3. **Persona:**  Be sure the persona is useful for understanding the target users/stakeholders that the solution was designed for.
4. **Robot Specifications:** Show and explain the multi-view drawing of your fully-functional robot design, as well as the task scenario diagrams for the robot prototype.
5. **Paper Prototype Evaluation:**  Briefly describe the participants \(number, gender, age, stakeholder role, etc.\) involved in the evaluation of your robot design, and briefly summarize the evaluation findings.
6. **Product Website:** Show your team's product website, and briefly explain how the website's content and design help effectively explain and market your team's robot concept.
7. **Robot Demonstration:**  Show your team's robot demo video. Briefly summarize the robot's task performance results.

The presentation should have 8-12 slides and take 5-10 minutes to deliver.
