{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
Create a **slide presentation** that explains and demonstrates the robot prototype that your team designed and developed as your project solution. Practice your presentation before delivering it to your class. This will be an opportunity for other project teams to ask questions and provide constructive feedback to help your team improve its solution.

Your team's presentation should include the following \(in this order\):

1. **Project Team:** product name, team name, team members & their roles
2. **Value Proposition:** If necessary, revise your team's value proposition to better match your solution. Be sure the value proposition is clear and compelling.
3. **Persona:**  If necessary, revise your team's persona to better match the target users or stakeholders for your solution. Be sure the persona is useful for understanding the target users/stakeholders that the solution was designed for.
4. **Robot Specifications:** If necessary, revise your team's robot specifications to better match your solution. Show the multi-view drawing of your fully-functional robot design, and briefly summarize the robot specifications.
5. **Paper Prototype:** Use diagrams, photos, or video to briefly show and explain the task scenarios demonstrated with your team's paper prototype.
6. **Paper Prototype Evaluation:**  Briefly describe the participants \(number, gender, age, etc.\) involved in the user testing of the paper prototype of the robot task scenarios, and briefly summarize the evaluation findings.
7. **Product Website:** Show your team's product website, and briefly explain how the website's content and design help effectively explain and market your team's robot concept.
8. **Robot Demonstration:**  Show your team's robot demo video. Briefly describe the results of your internal performance evaluation of the robot prototype.

The presentation should have 8-12 slides and take 5-10 minutes to deliver.
