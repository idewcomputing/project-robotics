# 2.4 Robot Demo Environment

{% hint style="danger" %}
**UPDATE IN PROGRESS:** This assignment is being updated.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
Your team will create your robot's demonstration environment, so it has the necessary features and objects to demonstrate your robot task scenarios.

Your teacher should confirm how each team will construct and layout its 6 ft × 6 ft robot demonstration environment. The demo environments may need to be **portable**, so they can be stored and transported \(e.g., between class meetings or for the public presentation event\). For example:

* If there is sufficient floor space in the classroom or hallway, each team might receive a designated 6 ft × 6 ft floor space. Electrical tape \(or masking tape, etc.\) could be used to outline the perimeter of each space.
* Butcher paper could be used to create the environments.  Each team would tape together 2 pieces of 3 ft × 6 ft butcher paper, in order to form a 6 ft × 6 ft sheet.
* Poster board could be used to create the environments. Each team could use 6 pieces of 2 ft × 3 ft poster board, in order to form a 6 ft × 6 ft environment.

### Instructions

1. **Use your team's robot specifications to determine the specific objects and features needed for your robot demonstration environment**.
   * Determine which objects and features will be **stationary** and which need to be **movable**.
     * **Stationary features** will remain fixed in place throughout your robot demonstration \(same location across all task scenarios\).
     * **Movable features** will change location during your robot demonstration \(either during a task scenario or between scenarios\).
   * Determine which objects and features will be **2D representations** and which should be **3D representations**.
     * **2D representations:**  Lines can be used for paths, boundaries, etc. Paper can be used to create flat representations of certain features \(even if the real-life feature isn't flat\).
     * **3D representations:**  Cardboard and other materials can be used to create or represent walls, objects, obstacles, etc.
2. **Construct the objects and features needed for your team’s robot demonstration environment.** Necessary materials and tools might include:  paper, cardboard, adhesive tape \(for building or securing objects\), scissors, tape measure, markers, etc. Your teacher will identify which materials and tools will be provided, as well as where each team can store its objects and materials.
   * Use your team's task scenario diagrams to help determine the correct size for each object or feature.
   * If necessary, add details, color, label, etc. to make certain features visually distinct or identifiable. The purpose is to make your demonstration easy to understand and compelling to viewers.
   * **Set up your team’s robot demo environment with its objects and features**. Be sure your robot will have sufficient space within the environment for driving, turning, etc.
3. * **Take photos of your testing environment layout.** If your testing scenarios will require different layouts, then take a photo of each scenario’s layout. Use an image editor \(such as Google Drawing, etc.\) to annotate each photo with text and arrows to identify the testing environment features. If helpful, include sizes and/or positions of features.
   * **Use your testing environment to test and verify the programming of your robot's tasks and behaviors.** Your team will most likely find it necessary to modify your testing environment and/or your robot's program, in order for the robot to successfully complete its tasks and perform its behaviors. As necessary, update your paper prototype and take new photos \(so you can set up the testing environment accurately for the next test or demonstration\).

{% hint style="success" %}
**CLEAR THE WAY:**  The robot needs a path that is about 18" \(1.5 feet\) wide in order to drive forward and make turns. If you place walls and other obstacles too close together in the environment, your robot might not be able to navigate through them.
{% endhint %}

**NOTE:** For the final public demonstration at the end of the project, each team will set up its own dedicated testing environment. It is highly recommended that teams set up and test their dedicated environments prior to the day of this event.

## **❏ Deliverable**

Submit an annotated photo of your team's completed robot demo environment
