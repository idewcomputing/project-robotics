# 2.7 Product Website

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
Your team will create a **one-page product marketing website** for your robot solution, which will include a [robot demo video](2.8-robot-demo-video.md) that your team will create. This website will be made **public** to allow more people to learn about your robot project.

1. Gather and/or create the content \(text, images, video, etc.\) for your team’s product marketing website. As necessary, tailor the content to your target users, as represented by your team's persona. Be sure the content is clear, concise, engaging, and professional. Your website should include the following \(but you can add other content if helpful\):
   * Product Name
   * Product Description \(can use value proposition as starting point\)
   * Robot Conceptual Design \(multi-view drawing of fully-functional robot concept\)
   * Features \(list tasks that robot can perform\)
   * Tech Specs \(list robot's specifications\)
   * Robot Demo Video \(demonstration of robot prototype performing tasks\)
2. Create a visual design for your team's website that will be engaging, professional, and reinforce your product concept. As necessary, tailor the design to your target users.
   * Sketch possible ideas for the overall layout of the content on the webpage.
   * Determine the final layout and its overall style \(such as: colors, fonts, etc.\)
3. Build the website using a tool such as [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/create?usp=drive_web) \(available within Google Drive, see guide to [Get Started with Sites](https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/products/sites/get-started/)\) – or code the website directly using HTML and CSS.
   * Include a temporary placeholder for the robot demo video until it is ready to add to the website

In the next phase of the project, you'll test the website with people outside your team to determine how effective the website is at explaining and marketing your team's solution.

## **❏ Deliverable**

Submit a link to your team's product website for its robot solution.
