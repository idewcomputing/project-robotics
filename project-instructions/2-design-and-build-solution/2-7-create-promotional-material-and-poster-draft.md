# 2-7 Create Promotional Material and Poster Draft

## Objectives

* Create a promotional image for your team’s robot that can be used for both web and print purposes.
* Create a first draft of your team’s poster that will be displayed during the public project presentation and robot demonstration.

## Instructions

1. **Create a promotional image \(3 in × 5 in\) for your team’s robot that can be used for both web and print purposes.**
   * The promotional image should be visually engaging, communicate the core concept of your robot, and interest people in learning more about your robot.
   * For text within the image, you should include the name of your robot and a slogan/tagline. Additional text can be included if desired, but avoid too much text.
   * Your teacher might have specific information that must be included on the promotional image in a specific format and/or location \(such as: team name, class period, etc.\).
   * You can create the image by hand, digitally \(using an image editor or illustration app\), or a combination. However, the final format of the promotional image will need to be digital.
2. **Create a first draft of your team’s poster \(36 in × 24 in\) that will be displayed during the public project presentation and robot demonstration.**
   * The poster should be visually engaging, highlight the key features of your team’s robot concept, and highlight the key steps to design, build, and evaluate your working prototype. You can incorporate information and images from your team's previous assignments.
   * Your teacher might have specific information that must be included on the poster in a specific format and/or location \(such as: team name, class period, etc.\).
   * Create the poster draft using an image editor or illustration app. Here is a [Google Drawing template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1P1VvVowYOVigmfaMk8sjMy-9X94Pzwxb45FiZQ_Y1tA) that's pre-sized to 36 inches × 24 inches \(zoom in to add and edit text, images, etc.\). Also, here is a [general guide for making posters](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-w3JrxBYwZBDWLFvLAzEYzPkPWs0ehR74EywV92LtM/edit?usp=sharing).
   * Later, the final version of your poster \(assignment 3-5\) will be printed and displayed during the public project presentation and robot demonstration.
3. **Have your team members review the promotional image and poster draft to provide feedback on possible improvements.**
