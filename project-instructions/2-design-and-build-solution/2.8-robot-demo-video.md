{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
Your team will create a **product demo video** that will briefly demonstrate and explain your working smart device prototype and its web app. You'll include the video in your team's [product marketing website](2.6-product-website.md).

1. Create a script and [narrative storyboard](https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/design-practices/narrative-storyboards) for your team's product demo video, which should be about 1-2 minutes in length. As necessary, tailor the video content to your target users, as represented by your team's persona. Be sure the video will be clear, concise, engaging, and professional.
   * For the script, be sure you'll show and explain what the smart device and web app do, as well as the value they provide to users.
   * For the storyboard, decide which [types of camera shots](https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/design-practices/narrative-storyboards#types-of-camera-shots) will be most effective for the different parts or scenes in the video. When necessary, be sure to capture close-up shots of the smart device or web app to show important details.
2. Use your script and storyboard to practice the video.
   * The person\(s\) that will act and/or narrate should practice what they will do and/or say.
   * The camera person should practice capturing the camera shots using different camera movements \(tilting up or down, panning left or right, zooming in or out, etc.\).
   * If your team can record the final video \(and its audio\) in one continuous take, you'll avoid or minimize the need to edit the video.
3. Record and finalize the video.
   * If necessary, record additional takes.
   * If necessary, edit the video to finalize it \(cut and splice scenes, add titles or captions, add narration or background music, etc.\).
   * Upload the final video to a site \(such as: Google Drive, YouTube, etc.\) that will allow you to embed \(or link to\) the video in your team’s product marketing website.

### **❏ Deliverable**

Submit a link to your team's product demo video for its smart device solution.

{% tab title="➤ EXAMPLE" %}
Here's a real-life example of a product video:  [Fitbit Charge 3 fitness tracker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omJhc4iv4z4)

Because your team's device is a first version prototype, your video will be more of a demonstration, rather than a polished commercial for a finished product.
