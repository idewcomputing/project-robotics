# 2 Design & Build Solution

Prepare the robot specifications and create a prototype that demonstrates your intended features. Evaluate your prototype and make refinements before programming your robot. Organize a development strategy and tracking process to methodically create your solution with efficiency and quality. Conduct basic tests to ensure the most obvious problems are addressed. Develop promotional material to share with the public and begin to prepare your poster for the final event.
