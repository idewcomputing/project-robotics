# 2 DESIGN & BUILD SOLUTION

![](../../.gitbook/assets/phase-2-process.png)

Create a schedule to design and develop your solution, based on the available time and resources. Define design specifications for your robot prototype, as well as for your fully-functional robot concept. Use a paper prototype of your task scenarios to evaluate them with external users, and make any necessary refinements. Construct your robot's demonstration environment, and program your robot prototype to perform its tasks. Internally test your robot solution to verify its effectiveness, measure its performance, and identify any issues. Create a product website and demo video to help explain and show your robot solution to others. Use your project schedule to continually track your team's progress, in order to finish on time. Demonstrate your solution to the class.

This phase of the project will require about 5-7 weeks to complete. Your teacher will identify the specific deadline\(s\) for the task assignments.
