# 2 Design & Build Solution

![](../../.gitbook/assets/phase-2-process.png)

Create a schedule to design and develop your solution, based on the available time and resources. Define the robot specifications, and create a paper prototype that demonstrates your task scenarios. Evaluate your task scenarios using the paper prototype, and make refinements. Program your robot's tasks, and construct your demonstration environment. Internally test your robot solution to verify its effectiveness and identify any issues. Create a product website and demo video to explain your robot solution to others. Continually track your team's progress to finish on time.
