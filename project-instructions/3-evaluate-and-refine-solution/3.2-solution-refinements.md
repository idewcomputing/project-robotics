# 3.2 Solution Refinements

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
Your team will use your evaluation findings to **implement refinements to your smart device solution and product marketing website**. Focus on the highest priority design changes first. Implement as many refinements as possible depending on the available time and resources prior to the public presentation.

If possible, test your solution or website again with new participants to verify whether the refinements resolved the issues.

{% hint style="success" %}
**CROSS-CHECK:**  If you make changes to your smart device, device app, or web app, then check whether your product marketing website or product demo video will also need to be updated. For example, if you change the interface screen of the web app, you might need to update the web app screenshots on the website.
