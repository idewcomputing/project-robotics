# 3.2 Solution Refinements

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
Your team will use your evaluation findings to **implement refinements to your robot prototype and product website**. Focus on the highest priority design changes first. Implement as many refinements as possible depending on the available time and resources prior to the public presentation.

If possible, test your robot or website again with new participants to verify whether the refinements resolved the issues.

{% hint style="success" %}
**CROSS-CHECK:** If you make changes to your robot prototype, then check whether your product website or product demo video will also need to be updated. For example, if you change one of the robot's tasks, you might need to update the robot features listed on the website or re-record part of the demo video.
